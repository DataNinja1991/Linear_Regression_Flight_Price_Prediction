# Linear_Regression_Flight_Price_Prediction

In this data science project, our objective is to construct predictive models for forecasting flight prices, leveraging a diverse set of features. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to analyze historical flight data and identify patterns that influence ticket pricing. The project involves extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance model accuracy. Ultimately, our goal is to provide travelers with reliable predictions, aiding them in making informed decisions about booking flights.
